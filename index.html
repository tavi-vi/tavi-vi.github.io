			<p>Hi, I'm Tavi. I have opinions and I touch computers.</p>
			<p>My hobbies include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>programming computers</li>
				<li>administering computers</li>
				<li>making sounds sound better (with computers)</li>
				<li>being frustrated at computers</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I like to think I can do things better than other people, so hopefully, this site will be
				full of information presented in a way that's more digestable by people who have mental illnesses similar to mine.
