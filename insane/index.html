				<p>This is a collection of hopefully useful introductions, and complete guides to doing things. My goal is to avoid the <em>Curse of Knowledge</em>. We don't need yet another seasoned Haskell programmer describing monads.</p>
				<p>This series will be written from the perspective of a girl with one or more "learning disabilities". This hasn't stopped me, despite the name, from learning. I just find most presentation lacking.</p>
				<p>I like to understand things in depth, because I have trouble mentalizing things without knowing most of the abstractions underlying it. So these entries will answer the questions I wanted answers to and found hard to find, and hopefully answer them in a way that I would have found indespensible when I was exploring something new.</p>
